# Meeting 8.2 Exercise

You will focus on two deliverables for this exercise.  First, you will incorporate recommendations made by the instructor (me) regarding your initial draft statement.  Second, assuming your proposed data set meets the minimum criteria specified (i.e., ~ 7-10 tables with at least one many-to-many relationship defined between two of the entities) you will proceed to produce a logical data model of your chosen data set.

As was the case in an earlier assignment, the design of your logical data model must reflect a data normalization strategy that adheres to the requirements imposed by third normal form (3NF). Identify candidate entities and establish entity relationships in terms of their cardinality (e.g. one-to-many, many-to-many). Ensure that data you identify as an attribute of a particular entity (i.e., a property) express a fact about the entity and no other entity. The goal is a logical data model that eliminates data duplication and ensures referential integrity.

You will submit both the revised proposal and data model for review.
