# Meeting 9.3 Exercise

You will focus on the following deliverable for this exercise. 

1. Create an empty Github repo.  Name it for your new project.

2. Create a local working directory.

3. Add a .gitignore file (copy the one you are using in your heritagessites repo)

4. Add a README.md file written in Markdown with the following subheadings :

# Project Name

## Purpose

## Data set

## Data model

## Package Dependencies

Take your project proposal and weave it into the above structure.  Take a screenshot of your data model.  Create a /static/img/ directory and store it there, giving it a sensible name.  The Package Dependencies section you will fill out later.

If you are new to Markdown have a look at the following resources:

You can also review all the docs in the [SI664-docs](https://github.com/UMSI-SI664-2018Fall/SI664-docs) repo. They are all written in Markdown.

Once you've drafted your README, stage, commit, and push your changes to your new repo.  Then take a screenshot of your new repo and upload it to this assignment page.  Name it: <uniqname>-final-project_repo.png.
